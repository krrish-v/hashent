    <p><b>This tool is created to make your storage file secure from every type of attack where it is a social engennering or any other type of outsider attack</b></p>
    <p><i>Why I create this?</i></p>
    <p><b>Actually I used to store some of the very important details in my pendrive, I was concerned if this pendrive gets to someone else, then it will be a trouble for me, so I decided to create some something to hide it, and reached here</b></p>
    <br><p>This tool encryptes the file to avoid human readble, it uses the hybrid encryption AES and ECC algorithm for generating keys, it is full created in python programming language, this program is full compactiable in every situation, you can use it like a single standonle file which works independent on its alone directory</p>
    <br><p><u>Some usage of it are there--</u></p>
      <br>1. when you open it for first time, you will have to enter the salt as just like a password, make sure you dont forget that otherwise, you will not recover your encrypted file again

    <br>2. After that click on next button, then a new window will appear to you it will be similar like this

    <br>6. There is one other cool feature to make changes and view the encrypted text file without decrypting it, thats what the "Text Edittor" button do. Its open the file that are in the text file format images, pdfs and other formats are not supported in this version
